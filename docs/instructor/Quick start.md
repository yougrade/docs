### Test Files
The test files can be any format depending on the grading container. For the default `Jagr`-based container, the test files be a zip archive containing the following files:

```plaintext title="test-files.zip"
.
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ graders
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“¦ HXX-Private-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ libs
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“¦ HXX-Private-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-libs.jar
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“„ jagr.conf
```

## Submissions
After you have created an assignment, you can now import the submissions from Moodle. Therefore, on moodle, navigate to Course administration > Reports > Task overview. Click on the task you want to import the submissions from. Only select `submissions` as we do not need any existing feedback. Finally, click on the `Download files` button. You will get a zip archive containing the submissions.

You can also create your own archive, but it has to be in the following format (the filename of the archive does not matter, but the files inside have to be named as follows):

```plaintext title="submissions.zip"
.
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ Abgabe zu Ãœbungsblatt XX _ Firstname Lastname - ab12cdef
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ submissions
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“¦ <anyName>.jar
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ Abgabe zu Ãœbungsblatt XX _ Firstname2 Lastname2 - bc23defg
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ submissions
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“¦ <anyName2>.jar
..
```
???+ tip "Hint"
    The `submissions` folder is mandatory and has to be named exactly like that. The `<anyName>.jar` files can be named anything, but they have to be in the `submissions` folder. To be precise, only files matching
    ```ts
    /Abgabe[^0-9]*(?<assignmentId>[0-9]{1,2}) _ (?<name>[^-]*) - (?<studentId>[a-z]{2}[0-9]{2}[a-z]{4})\/submissions\/.*\.jar/
    ```
    will be imported. The `assignmentId` is the number of the assignment, the `name` is the name of the student, and the `studentId` is the student's id.

Now in Yougrade, click on the `Import Submissions` button. You will be prompted to upload the zip archive. After you have uploaded the archive, the submissions will be imported and you can start grading.

???+ tip "Hint"
    Manually refresh the page if the submissions are not displayed immediately.

## Grading
After you have imported the submissions, you can start grading. Either click the `Grade all submissions` button to grade all submissions at once, select the submissions you want to grade, and click the `Grade selected submissions` button, or click on the `Grade` button next to a submission to grade it individually. To track the status of the grading, you can click on the `Jobs` option in the navigation bar.

When the grading is finished, you should see the results of the grading in the table. For each submission, you can view a detailed report by clicking on the `View` button.  

## Exporting Grades
You can export either the grades of a single assignment or all assignments. To export the grades of a single assignment, click on the `View` button of the assignment you want to export and then click on the `Export CSV` button. To export the grades of all assignments, click on the `Export CSV` button in the Assignment's page.

## Uploading Grades to Moodle
After you have exported the grades, you can upload them to Moodle. Therefore, navigate to the assignment page, click on `Show grades` > `Actions` > `Upload grade table`. Select the exported CSV file and click on the `Upload this file` button. The grades will be uploaded to Moodle.

???+ tip "Hint"
    This process has not been verified to work for larger courses yet. It might be necessary to split the CSV file into smaller parts.
